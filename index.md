HUNTER is a virtual nuclear power plant model for dynamic human reliabiltiy analysis.

HUNTER uses GOMS (Goals, a set of Operators, a set of Methods for achieving the goals, and a set of Selections rules; Card & Moran 1983) primitives and SPAR-H PSFs (Performance Shaping Factors) to simulate the HEP (Human Error Probabilities) and timing for completing process control procedures utilizing dynamic integrated modeling and monte-carlo simulations.
